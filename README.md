You don't have to understand/remeber all algorithms to be a programmer. 
But you will never be a good programmer without the understanding of algorithms, that why you need to practice algorithms everyday!
There are different types of algorithms and there also different ways of practicing, the easist one is to sorting data types.
Therefore, I keep alot of sorting algorithms here (they were coded in Java, but as you understand the concept, you can re-create them in other languages as well).
